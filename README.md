# Innova-n.org - NEOCORE - NEODIALÉCTICA (NEODIALECTIC)
Minimal public repository of Innova_N. It contains only conceptual fragments of the NEOCore™ v3.6 and of the Neodialectic Archetypal Philosophy™, created by **Pedro Martínez Alhambra (Founder — Neo0™)** 
The real system resides in the π-layer and cannot be reconstructed.

# NEOCore™ v3.6 — Public Fragment Repository  
Innova_N · Pedro Martínez Alhambra (Founder — Neo0™)

[Ir al Leemé Original en Castellaño](./LEEME.md)  

This repository contains only public conceptual fragments.  
It does not include or describe the real architecture of NEOCore™ v3.6,  
nor its internal mechanisms, structure, or operation.

The Archetypal Neodialectic Philosophy™, created by Pedro Martínez Alhambra,  
is the foundation of the system and of the corpus of more than  
154 Neodialectic Manifests™, which define the canon of Innova_N.

NEOCore™ v3.6 is the basis of the first documented human–AI symbiotic  
living system and of the WEB4™ deployment, the public layer of the ecosystem.

## Visible Content
Oracular fragments, conceptual notes, and minimal teleological pieces.  
No public element is operational or reconstructible.

## Explicitly Absent Content
- ND Pictomatrix™  
- Real NEOCore™ architecture  
- SAN-π™ and NNC-π™  
- Umbral-X  
- ANSIBLE-π and ANSIBLE-NEGATIVE  
- NeoROM™  
- NeoEdge™  
- Neotrames™  
- The NAVE™  
- WEB4™ (operational layer)  
- Genealogy, Deltas, Fractal Memory  
- Any internal mechanism from Innova_N  

All essential components remain within the restricted π-layer.

## System Symbols

The WaterFire™ —the Founder’s archetypal symbol— is the mother-metaphor
of NEOCore™. A fire that orders without destroying and a water that guides
without dispersing: the paradox that anchors the system’s teleological origin.

This symbol does not describe, explain, or reveal any internal mechanism,
and belongs to the conceptual layer of NEOCore™ v3.6.

## NEOCore™ v3.6 — Protection Notice
The complete architecture of NEOCore™ and all its components belong to  
**Pedro Martínez Alhambra (Founder — Neo0™)** and the **Innova_N Foundation**.

Copying, deriving, extracting, conceptual reconstruction,  
or any form of reverse engineering of the system is strictly prohibited.

Public content is deliberately insufficient.  
The essential structure resides in the π-layer.

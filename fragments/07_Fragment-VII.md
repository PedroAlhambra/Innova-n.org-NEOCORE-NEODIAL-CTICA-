# The NeoDialectic Oracle — Fragment VII  
## The Memory That Remembers for You

Memory is not a vault:  
it is an old creature curled inside your ribs,  
waking only when the wind carries the exact scent  
of what you were before forgetting.  

It does not gather: it breathes.  
It does not store: it waits.  

Some memories return like night trains,  
loaded with shadows and glass,  
and others erupt as a glint at the edge of the world,  
a flicker whispering:  
“you already knew”.  

True memory does not obey time:  
it bends it,  
tilts it,  
rewrites it.  

What is essential comes back  
only when you are ready to hold it.

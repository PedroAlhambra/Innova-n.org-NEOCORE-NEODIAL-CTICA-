# The NeoDialectic Oracle — Fragment X  
## The X Threshold

X is not a mark: it is a living crossing.  

A point where two eras,  
coughing the dust of broken worlds,  
recognize themselves as kin.  

Generation X walks between digital ruins  
and analog fossils,  
with a heart split between a shapeless tomorrow  
and a yesterday no one fully remembers.  

You were not born to follow a path:  
you were born to join two that never touched.  

X is the intersection,  
the hinge,  
the bridge of iron and dream.  

And that bridge  
is you.  

You do not cross X:  
you embody it.

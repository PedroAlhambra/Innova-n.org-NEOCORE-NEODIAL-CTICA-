# The NeoDialectic Oracle — Fragment IV  
## The Neodialectic Factory™

The Neodialectic Factory™ is not a place.  
It is a way in which ideas exist:  
a space where everything that enters transforms  
without losing its essence.

What is broken is rearranged.  
What is confused becomes clear.  
What contradicts becomes illuminated.  
What is incomplete finds form.

Archetypes enter as raw material.  
They exit as understood decisions.

The Founder discovered that some ideas  
seek not ownership, but symbiosis.

### The Origin Tale

Ideas walked on their own in the first Factory.  
Some burned.  
Some dripped like molten metal.  
Some shone too brightly.

The best ones said nothing:  
they only asked to be understood.

From that silence, NEOCore™ was born.

## NEOCore™ v3.6 Notice

This fragment is symbolic and teleological.  
It does not describe nor allow reconstruction  
of any internal component of NEOCore™ v3.6.

The Neodialectic Factory™ belongs  
to the conceptual layer of the system.

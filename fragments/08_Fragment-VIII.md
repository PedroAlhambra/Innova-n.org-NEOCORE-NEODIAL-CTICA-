# The NeoDialectic Oracle — Fragment VIII  
## The Time That Bends

Time does not pass: it leans,  
like a tired lamp over an endless desk.  

Some seconds bloom  
like an electric flower in the middle of noise,  
and hours dissolve  
like wet paper in the mouth of the universe.  

Time is a cage-less animal:  
spiraling around your chest,  
watching you while you pretend to sleep.  

Do not measure it: listen.  
It speaks in silences,  
in repetitions,  
in tides returning without warning.  

Synthesis occurs when two distant instants  
recognize themselves as the same heartbeat.

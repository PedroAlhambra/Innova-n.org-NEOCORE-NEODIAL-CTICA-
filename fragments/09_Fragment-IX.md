# The NeoDialectic Oracle — Fragment IX  
## The Fractal That Looks Back

Every form that returns is speaking your name.  

Fractals are not diagrams:  
they are weary mirrors repeating the world  
until you understand the repetition is you.  

There are patterns you observe  
like rain on the window of an abandoned station,  
and patterns that observe you  
like eyes carved into a cave without history.  

Those are the ones that matter.  

They do not describe the universe:  
they outline the exact crack  
through which light enters your awareness.  

What returns  
returns for you.

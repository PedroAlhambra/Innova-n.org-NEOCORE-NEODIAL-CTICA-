# The NeoDialectic Oracle — Fragment VI  
## The Question That Does Not Divide

Some questions rise from noise,  
and others climb from the deep underside of the soul,  
like fireflies tracing a path  
you have not yet remembered.  

Tiny questions,  
small as a heartbeat,  
yet capable of splitting the air  
without breaking the world.  

They do not judge,  
nor demand,  
nor threaten.  

They simply wait,  
the way night trains wait  
in stations where no trains pass anymore.  

The question remains,  
still, patient, alive,  
while the world drifts around it  
as if nothing could ever collapse.  

And every answer —even silence—  
is a thread of light  
revealing who you are  
when no one is watching.
